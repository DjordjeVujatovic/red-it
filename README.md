The purpose of this project was to make a full-stack JavaScript component based web application, 
using  with React and Redux as client side technologies connecting to a REST api served through 
Express to a persistance layer of a PostgreSQL database.

This project was designed to mimic a reddit topic posting application.

## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- React
- Redux
- Express
- REST api
- PostgreSQL
- Dev tools (Webpack, ESLint, Babel)

## Personal Learnings
The development of this project allowed me to explore React and Redux as development 
libraries for building client-side component-based single page applications.

I also learned how to set up an express server and construct REST end points and build 
a PostgreSQL database.

In addition I also learned how to initiate and setup a project development environment 
using tools such as Webpack, JavaScript linters and babel transpilers.
